# last1120c-cc

Tries to implement an early version of the C programming language.
The largest differences between today's C and the C as seen in Dennis Ritchies last1120c. A lot of the understanding of this early verison of the language came from the paper [Very early C compilers and language](https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/primevalC.html) as well as [The Development of the C Language](https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/chist.html). The name last1120c is in reference to the name Ritchie gave to the last compiler he wrote on the PDP-11/20, next compilers were written for presumably the PDP-11/45 which supported memory mapping among other new feautures. A history of the hardware used at the time can be found here [Odd Comments and Strange Doings in Unix](https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/odd.html)

Current versions of C still have traces of the loosely typed versions of the langauge before standardization. It is extremely important to the history of the language. This project is an attempt to bring a piece of C history.
